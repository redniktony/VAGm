;Comment: this appears to be first of its kind,all others were derived from this
;
; 10/15/03  First version
; 01/01/04  Adds support for label file redirection (beta 212.2)
;           Add Application data
; 05/02/04  Adds enhanced visualizations (beta 401.2) 
; 05/31/04  Add undoumented blocks 6,9,10 (there are at least 25 available)
; 07/15/04  Replaced "Undocumented" with typical values
;
