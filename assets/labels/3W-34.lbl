;
;Explanation of why this redirect file exists
;
;This file provides labels for the level control system on the Bentley Continental GT
;by calling up an existing label file for level control on the Phaeton.  It appears to 
;the author that both of these controllers (Phaeton and Bentley Continental GT) are identical, however, this
;label file has not been fully tested on the Bentley.
