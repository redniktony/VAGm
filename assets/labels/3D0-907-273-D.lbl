;
; NB: The only known difference between D suffix and A, B, C or no suffix is that D coding is different.
;
; includes measured value blocks, coding, and adaptation.  Also user guidance (remarks) embedded in the file.

; - new file created for D suffix controllers due to different coding.
; - the changeover appears to be with software version 25. 24 and under use the old coding scheme (3D0-907-273.lbl).
; - software version 25 and higher use the new coding scheme (this labelfile).

; measured value block information
;
;---------------------------------------------------
;
;NOTES CONCERNING TPMS ADAPTATION:
;Measure Value Blocks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 are stored only when the system is relearned. 
;Therefore this information is not always an accurate representation of current wheel location and status.
;In addition, one faulty wheel sensor has the potential to create faults at multiple wheel locations.
;
;How to identify current tire pressure monitoring sensor locations:
; – Vehicle must be parked 4 meters (12 feet) AWAY from other vehicles with same or similar tire pressure monitoring system.
;If vehicles with same or similar systems (e.g. other Phaetons or Touaregs) are parked too close to one another there is a 
;high probability of the systems interfering with each other.
;
;Battery life shown in MVB 2,5,8 and 11 Field 2 is only usable if the system has learned all wheel
;locations. If this is the case it can be determined in MVB 19, where 00025 is the standard value for
;a system that is active and set. If the system is not active (showing any other number in MVB 19), it
;will still show the last values that were stored the last time it was operating correctly. During the
;learning drive MVB 19 will start with 00265 and will add numbers to this field, until it reaches a
;maximum of 63545. This can be observed during the learning drive with the VAG-COM. If the setting
;value not reached within 30 minutes, an error message is generated. The duration of the test or
;learn drive depends on how fast the tires warm up. Highway will be faster than within the city, stop
;and go traffic might not set at all.
