;
;  Have not yet found:
;     Indicators related to manual mode button (MY2001)
;     Indicator related to 'jack mode'
;     Several 'unknown' variables
;
;  Certain conditions may not be observable, since VAG-COM requires ignition to be on,
;     but control module operates even with ignition off.
;
;  Adaptation channels:
;     Not logged in:
;        Only channel is 10, default value 0
;        Appears to be 1=Jack mode
;        
;     Logged in (LoginCode = 31564)
;        Suspension calibration can be performed. See "Nebuchadnezzar's" write up on AudiWorld
;           for complete information.

;
5,0,Suspension unit extension
;   Could these be extension distance for each shock? No units are given.
