;Explanation of why this redirect file exists
;
;This file provides measured value block labels for Park Distance Control on the Touareg
;by calling up an existing label file for Park Distance Control on the Phaeton.  It appears to 
;the author that both of these controllers (Phaeton and Touareg) are identical, however, this
;label file has not been fully tested on a Touareg.
